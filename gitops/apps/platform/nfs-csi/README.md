# NFS CSI

This chart creates an NFS CSI `StorageClass`.

Safe defaults:

- the storage class is off by default
- volume expansion is on
- the NFS server and export path are placeholders

Important note:

- this chart does not install the NFS CSI driver
- use it when the driver already exists in the cluster and you want GitOps to manage the `StorageClass`

Good first step:

1. install or confirm the NFS CSI driver
2. set the NFS server and export path
3. enable the storage class

Source used for the starter shape:

- the upstream NFS CSI driver uses `nfs.csi.k8s.io` as the provisioner and `server` and `share` parameters in the `StorageClass`

Docs:

- https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html

Secrets:

- If the StorageClass needs credentials (for example, if it pulls from an ESO-synced secret) keep those secrets in AWS Secrets Manager and reference them via ESO names.
