2. Store the required credentials in AWS Secrets Manager and sync them with ESO.
3. Update `clusters/<group-path>/<cluster>/values/redhat-insights.yaml`.
4. Enable the app in `gitops.yaml`.

## Main Inputs

- `namespace`: namespace where the Insights custom resource runs.
- `insights.credentialsSecret`: name of the ESO-managed Secret with the required credentials.

## Prerequisites

- An ESO-managed Secret with the credentials expected by the operator.
