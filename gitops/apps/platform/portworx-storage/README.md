# Portworx Storage

This chart gives you a starting point for a Portworx `StorageCluster`.

Safe defaults:

- the chart is off by default
- CSI is on inside the sample `StorageCluster`
- snapshot controller is on inside the sample `StorageCluster`
- Autopilot is off

Important note:

- Portworx recommends using its spec generator for real installs
- use this chart as a GitOps home for the final `StorageCluster` spec after you build it for your environment

Why this chart is simple:

- Portworx storage layout, disks, cloud access, and security settings are very environment-specific

Source used for the starter shape:

- Portworx says the main object is `StorageCluster`
- Portworx says the spec generator is the recommended way to build that object
