# NetApp Trident

This chart helps you start a NetApp Trident setup on OpenShift.

It can do two jobs:

- install the certified operator through OperatorHub
- create a `TridentOrchestrator` custom resource

Safe defaults:

- operator install is off
- `TridentOrchestrator` is off

Why these defaults are off:

- Trident needs storage backend details that are specific to your environment
- some Trident features need extra node prep, such as iSCSI

Good first step:

1. enable the operator install
2. install Trident
3. add backend and storage class settings after the operator is healthy

Source used for the starter shape:

- NetApp says to use the certified OpenShift operator and then create a `TridentOrchestrator` resource
- NetApp also notes that some node prep features need newer Trident versions on newer OpenShift releases
