# IBM Spectrum Scale CSI

This chart gives you a starting point for IBM Spectrum Scale CSI.

It can do two jobs:

- create a `CSIScaleOperator` custom resource
- create one or more `StorageClass` objects

Safe defaults:

- the driver custom resource is off
- no storage classes are created by default

Important note:

- IBM says the CSI operator needs cluster admin work and environment-specific setup
- use this chart after you are ready with your IBM Spectrum Scale cluster details

Good first step:

1. review IBM prerequisites
2. fill in the `CSIScaleOperator` spec for your environment
3. add storage classes only after the driver is healthy

Sources:

- IBM documents the `CSIScaleOperator` custom resource for driver setup
- IBM also documents OLM and CLI based install paths for OpenShift

Secrets:

- Keep any Spectrum Scale credentials in AWS Secrets Manager and sync them via ESO. Refer to the ESO secret name from your values files instead of committing raw credentials.
